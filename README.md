# final-projectï¼šA Data-Science Research of Terrorism Attacks Around The World
Terrorist attack is a violent form of political struggle that affects the confidence and security of citizens and ends in the destruction of order. In the current decade,  terrorist attacks around the world are still ongoing. Consequently, it is necessary to identify where the attacks were 
committed and where is the possible area for an attack. The objective is to provide assertive solutions to these events.

Our project focuses on one of the branches of Machine Learning, which is Ensemble Learning. The idea is to visualize and predict possible terrorist attacks using classification models, the XGboost. The input would be a database (GTD) that has a systematic record of worldwide terrorist attacks from 1970 to the last recorded year 2020, obtained from {https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/} with web automation test tool selenium. Necessary data exploration and visualization are analyzed to know the detailed of the database, and motives in text variables behind the terrorism attacks are processed and displayed as word cloud figure based on several natural language processing steps; Give a exhaustive and detailed study on XGboost model and be able to predict the number of terrorist attack occurrences in the future in application.
